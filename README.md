# Terraform Multi-Cloud Project

This Terraform project is designed to support the deployment and management of infrastructure across **multiple cloud providers**, including **AWS**, **Azure**, and **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**. The project follows a modular architecture to ensure flexibility, scalability, and ease of integration.

---

## Key Features

1. **Multi-Cloud Support:**
   - Provision infrastructure across AWS, Azure, and GCP using provider-specific modules.
   - Each cloud vendor has a dedicated module to handle unique configurations.

2. **Modular Architecture:**
   - Reusable Terraform modules for common resources like virtual networks, compute instances, and storage.
   - Environment-specific configurations (e.g., `dev`, `staging`, `prod`) to simplify infrastructure management.

3. **State Management:**
   - Remote backend support for storing Terraform state securely in cloud-native storage solutions (e.g., S3 for AWS, Azure Blob Storage, GCP Buckets).
   - Ensures collaboration and disaster recovery.

4. **Scalability:**
   - Easily extend the project to add more cloud providers or services.
   - Modular design allows for seamless updates and customizations.

5. **Automation-Ready:**
   - Supports integration with CI/CD pipelines for automated deployments.

## How to Use

### 1. Prerequisites
- Install [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads).
- Set up cloud provider credentials for AWS, Azure, and GCP.  
  Example configuration files:  
  - AWS: `~/.aws/credentials`  
  - Azure: Use the `az login` CLI.  
  - GCP: Set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable.

### 2. Initialize the Project
Navigate to the environment folder (e.g., `envs/prod`) and run:

```bash
terraform init
```

This will download the required providers and initialize the backend.

### 3. Select Cloud Provider and Configure
Modify `providers.tf` in the environment folder to specify the desired cloud provider. Example:  

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}
```

Or switch to Azure or GCP by updating the provider block.

### 4. Plan and Apply
To deploy the infrastructure, run:

```bash
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

### 5. Destroy Resources
To clean up resources:

```bash
terraform destroy
```

## Future Enhancements
- Add support for Kubernetes clusters (EKS, AKS, GKE).
- Integrate with monitoring tools like CloudWatch, Azure Monitor, and Stackdriver.
- Introduce policy-as-code validation with tools like Sentinel.
